With over a decade of experience in customer service, sales, and business development, I have been fortunate to work in high-performing teams to solve different customer needs, 
helping to improve customer engagement and relationships, thus driving revenue growth and exceeding goals. 
I recently successfully completed a computer programming program and I want to transfer my knowledge and experience to the IT sector. 
Passionate about programming, I am committed to continuous learning and growth, and I am confident that my skills, drive, and dedication will make me a 
valued contributor to your organization.
